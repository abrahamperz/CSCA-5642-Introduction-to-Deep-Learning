# CSCA 5622: Deep Learning

## Course Information
- **Institution**: University of Colorado Boulder
- **Course**: [CSCA5642: Deep Learning](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/academics/online-programs/mscs-coursera/csca5642)
- Author: Jose Abraham Perez Martinez
- **Instructor**: [Professor Geena Kim](https://www.colorado.edu/program/data-science/geena-kim)

## Project Overview
This project is the culmination of the CSCA5642. It involves applying various deep learning algorithms to a dataset to uncover trading opportunities by analyzing imbalances in limit order book (LOB) data for a given security. 

## Requirements
- **Python Version**: 3.9.6
- Jupiter Notebook
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `jupyter`
  - `ipython`


## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
    ```
Create a virtual environment:
 ```
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate`
 ```
Install the required libraries:

 ```pip install -r requirements.txt ```

Project Structure

- data/: Contains the dataset used for the project.

- notebooks/: Contains the Jupyter Notebook with the project code and analysis.

- results/: Contains the output files and visualizations generated by the notebook.

## Conclusion
Predicting market direction is inherently difficult. An accuracy significantly above the baseline
suggests the model has learned some predictive patterns from the chosen features and sequence length.
However, practical profitability would require further analysis including:

- Backtesting with realistic transaction costs and slippage.
- Analysis of Sharpe ratio or other risk-adjusted return metrics.
- Testing on more data (different days, different stocks).
- Additional hyperparameter tuning (seq_len, LSTM units, dropout, learning rate, dts horizon).
- Feature engineering (adding more LOB features, technical indicators, etc.).
